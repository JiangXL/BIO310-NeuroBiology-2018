# Part3, Neural Signaling
# 3.2 Ion channels and transportes


Functional studies of ion channels
- mRNA

The diversity of ion channels
- Ion channel genges contain a large number of coding regions that
- RNA 
- posttranlational
- subunit 

Voltage-gated ion channels: Na+(SCN), K+, Ca2+(CANNA)

Ligand-gated ion channels

Heat and stretch-activated channels
偶数保证 N-terimal and C-termial are inside cell mem

Chloride channel

Most volage-gated volage sensor

Structure of a voltage-gated K+ channel

Active transports
- ATP pumps
- electrochemical gradients of other ions

Na+/K+ is best understood active transporter
This transports accountes for 20% and 40% of the brain's total energy.
