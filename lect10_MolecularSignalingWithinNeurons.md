# 7. Molecular singaling within neurons

## Chemical signaling
Chemical communication coordinates the behavior of individual nerve and glial
cells in physiological processes that range from neural differentiation to
learning and memory. To carry out such communication, a series of
extraordinarily diverse and complex chemical signaling pathways has evolved.
The essential componets of chemical signaling contains: signaling cell, signal,
receptor, target molecule and response. Here are 3 major forms of chemical
signaling: synaptic transmission, paracrine signling(旁分泌) and 
endocrine(内分泌) signaling.


### Cell impermeant: have transmembrane receptor
short-lived, rapidly 

### Cell-permeant molecues
insoluble in aqueous

### Cell-associated molecules
adhesion mlecues, physical conact be


## Receptor types
Binding of singal molecules causes a conformational chagne in the recdptor, which
then triggers the subsequent signaling cascade within the affected cell. The 
receptors for impermeant signal molecules are membrane-spanning proteins, while
intracelluar receptors are activated by cell-permeant or lipophilic singaling
molecules. Channel-linked receptors have the receptor and transduing functions
as part of the same protein molecule. And the intracellular domain of enzyme-linked
receptors is an enzyme whose catalytic activity is regulated by the binding of
an extracellular signal.

Enzyeme-liked receptors: protein kinasee

GPCR

directly bind to and activate inon channels, In summary, the binding of chemical
signals to their recetpor activate, the diversity of G-protein and 
their downsteram, influence the membrane poteial
