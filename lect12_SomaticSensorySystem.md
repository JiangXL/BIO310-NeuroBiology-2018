# Part 4, Sensation and Sensory Processing

## 4.1 Somatic sensory system: Touch and Proprioception

The complex system can be divided into fucntionally distinct subsystems with
distinct sets of peripheral receptors and central pathways. One subsystem
transmits information form cutaneous(皮肤) mechanoreptors ans mediates the 
senations of fine touch, vibration, and pressure. Another originates in
specialized receptors that are asociated with muscles, tendous, and joints ans
responsible for proprioception(本体感受)---our ability to sense the position of
our own limbs and other body parts in space. A third subsystem arises from
receptors that supply information about painful stimuli and changes in
temperature as well as coarse touch. 

## From the skin surface to central circuits
In general, the afferent fibers convey somatic sensory information to the central nervous
system. Firstly, the somatic sensation originates from the skin or muscle. A
stimulus alters the permeability of cation channels in the afferent nerve
endings, generating a depolaring current konwn as receptor potential.
Action potentials generated in afferent fibers by events that occur in the skin
or in muscle propagate along the fiber and past the location of the cell body
in the ganglia. 


## Summary
The acitivity is conveyed centrally via a chain of nerve cells, referred to as
the first-, second-, and third-order neurons.
- First-order neurons are located in the dorsal root and cranial nerve ganglia.
- Second-order neuros are loacted in brainstem nuclei.
- Third-order neurons are found in the thalamus, from whence they project to
the cerebral cortex.
