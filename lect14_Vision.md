# Vision --- The Eye

The human visual system is extraordinary in the quantity and quality of 
information it supplies about the world. Equally remarkable is the fact that
viewers can discren visual information ovesr a wide range of stimulus 
intensities, from th faint light of dstart at ngiht to bright sunlight.

The next two cahpters describe the molecular, cellular, and higher order
memcahnisms that allows us to see. The first setps in the process of seeing
involve transmission and refraction of light by the opics of the eyes, the
transduction oflight energy into electrical signals by photoreceptors, and
the refinement of these signals by synpaitic interaction with the neural
circuits of the retina.

The anatomy of human eye are show in figure.
## Retina

Nural portion of the eye, is part of th ecetral nervous system.

## Phototransduction

In dark,  -40mV; in lighat -65mV.

Why

## Retinoid Cycle

## Functinoal Specialization of the Rod and Cone Systems

在黑暗的时候，看到的东西都是黑白的。

夜盲: lost the function of rod

Rod can actived by a photo, 

Degree of convergence,

## The distribution of Rods and Cones
Rod: 90 million
Cone: 4.5 million
30 micron focus area.

## Cones and Color Vision

cones have three type of photogiment
