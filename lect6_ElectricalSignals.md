# Part3, Neural Signaling
# 3.1 Electrical signals of nerve cells

We can use microelectrode to measure the electrical signals of nerve cells.

Neurons employ several different types of electrical signals to encode and
transfer information. When nerve cells are at rest, the resting membrane
potential if -40~-90mv
