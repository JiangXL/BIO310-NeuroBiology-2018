## Ipsilateral RGCs Are Repelled by Contralateral RGCs In Vitro in a Boc- and Smo-Dependent Manner
Next, we wonder whether this shh can repel Ispilateral RGCs. 
Here are another experiment in vitro. Firstly, we take out the Ispilateral from
E16.5. Then explant culture in vitro to observe the behavior for a time.

Here two exmple of interactions between lpsi-->contra and contra-->contra.
....

You can see the data...
application of Shh induces collapse of Boc-positive growth cones in RGC explants in a Smoothened (Smo)-dependent manne

## Knockdown of Shh in the Retina Reduces the Proportion of Ipsilateral Axons in a Non-cell-automous Manner
To confirm the pathway of shh, this paper choose to take out one of the eye in 
E13.5, then compare the ratio of Ipsilateral and Contralateral in optical 
chiasm. Finally, they get result as C, this change offset is close to 87%.

But here maybe other factors. They also function of axon guidance. So they design
a new experiment using Shh siRNA to knockdown the Shh in the retina. Sample treat
with ssiRNA express less 33% than control group. Then, aurthors also try to rescue
the sample treat with siRNA. The Ipsilateral number back the origin as control
group. These 3 experiments are consistent with each other, knockdown of shh in the
retina reduces the proportion of Ipsilateral axons in a non-cell-autonomous manner,
support the model: Shh secreted by contralateral RGCs at the optic chiasm acts on
ipsilateral RGCs to repel them in a non-cell-autonomous manner.






> SHH signaling still is local regulation in some way?
