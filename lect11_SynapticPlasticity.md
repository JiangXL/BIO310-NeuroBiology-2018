# 8.Synaptic Plasticity

Synaptic connections between neurons provide the basic "wiring" of the brains'
circuitry. However, in contrast to the wiring of an electronic device such a
computer, synaptic connectivity between neurons is a dynamics entity. Such
changes in synaptic transmission arise from a number of forms of plasticity that
vary in time scale from milliseconds to years. Most short-term forms of synaptic
plasticity affect the amount of neurotransmitter released from presynaptic
terminals in response to a presynaptic action potential. Several forms of
short-term synaptic plasticity--- including facilitation, augmentation, and
potentiation --- enhance neurotransmitter release and are caused by persistent
actions of calcium ions with in the presynaptic terminal. Another form of
short-term plasticity, synaptic depression, decreases the amount of
neurotransmitter released and appears to ge due to an activity-dependent
depletion of synaptic vesicles that ready to undergo exocytosis. 

## Short-term synaptic plasticity
The amount of neurotransmitter released from presynaptic terminals and are
based on alterations in Ca2+ signaling and synaptic vesicle pools at recently
active terminals.

## Long-term synaptic plasticity
Longer-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity such as LTP and LTD are also based
on Ca2+ and other intracellular second messengers.

- At least some of the synaptic changes produced by these long-lasting forms of
plasticity are postsynaptic, caused by changes in neurotransmitter receptor
trafficking, although alterations in neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic
terminal can also occur.
- In these more enduring forms of plasticity, protein phosphorylation and changes
in gene expression greatly outlast the period of synaptic activity and can yield
changes in synaptic strength that persist for hours, days, or even longer.

## Habituation & Sensitization
Aplysia exhibit several elementary forms of behavioral plasticity. One form is
**habituation**, a process that causes the animmal to become less responsive to
repeated occurence of a stimulus.

The gill-withdrawal response of *Aplysia* exhibits another form of plasticity
called **sensitization**. Sensitization is a process that allows an animal to
generalize an aversive response eclicited by a noxious stimulus to a variety 
of other, non-noxious stimuli.
