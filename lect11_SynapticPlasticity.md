# 8.Synaptic Plasticity

Synaptic connections between neurons provide the basic "wiring" of the brains'
circuitry. However, in contrast to the wiring of an electronic device such a
computer, synaptic connectivity between neurons is a dynamics entity. Such
changes in synaptic transmission arise from a number of forms of plasticity that
vary in time scale from milliseconds to years. Most short-term forms of synaptic
plasticity affect the amount of neurotransmitter released from presynaptic
terminals in response to a presynaptic action potential. Several forms of
short-term synaptic plasticity--- including facilitation, augmentation, and
potentiation --- enhance neurotransmitter release and are caused by persistent
actions of calcium ions with in the presynaptic terminal. Another form of
short-term plasticity, synaptic depression, decreases the amount of
neurotransmitter released and appears to ge due to an activity-dependent
depletion of synaptic vesicles that ready to undergo exocytosis. 

## Short-term synaptic plasticity
The amount of neurotransmitter released from presynaptic terminals and are
based on alterations in Ca2+ signaling and synaptic vesicle pools at recently
active terminals.

An enduring change in the functional strength of synaptic onnections thus
constitutes the cellular mechanism mediating short-term habituation. As with
change of this type occurs at several sits in the gill-whithdraw reflex circuit,
memory is distibuted and shorec throught the circuit. Depression of synaptic
transmission by sensory neurons, internerurons, or both is a common mechanism
underlying habituation of escape responses of crayfish and cockroaches as well
as startle reflexes in vertebrates.

## Long-term synaptic plasticity
Longer-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity such as LTP and LTD are also based
on Ca2+ and other intracellular second messengers.

- At least some of the synaptic changes produced by these long-lasting forms of
plasticity are postsynaptic, caused by changes in neurotransmitter receptor
trafficking, although alterations in neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic
terminal can also occur.
- In these more enduring forms of plasticity, protein phosphorylation and changes
in gene expression greatly outlast the period of synaptic activity and can yield
changes in synaptic strength that persist for hours, days, or even longer.

## Habituation & Sensitization
Aplysia exhibit several elementary forms of behavioral plasticity. One form is
**habituation**, a process that causes the animmal to become less responsive to
repeated occurence of a stimulus.

The gill-withdrawal response of *Aplysia* exhibits another form of plasticity
called **sensitization**. Sensitization is a process that allows an animal to
generalize an aversive response eclicited by a noxious stimulus to a variety 
of other, non-noxious stimuli.

## Classical conditioning ##
During conditioning the modulatory interneurons activated by tail shock relase
serotonin shortly _after_ siphon touch has trigered an action potential in the
sensory neurons. The action potential triggers an influx of Ca2+ into the
sensory neuron's presynaptic terminals, the Ca2+ binds to calmodulin, and the
complex in turn binds to adenylyl cyclase. This primes the adenylyl cyclase so
that it responds more vigorously to the serotonin released following the 
unconditioned stimulus at the tail. As a result, the production of cAMP is
enhanced, which increase the amount of presynaptic facilitation. If order of
stimulus is reversed so that serotonin release precedes Ca2+ influx in the
presynaptic terminals, there no potentiation and no classic conditioning.
