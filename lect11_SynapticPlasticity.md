# 8.Synaptic Plasticity

Synaptic connections between neurons provide the basic "wiring" of the brains'
circuitry. However, in contrast to the wiring of an electronic device such a
computer, synaptic connectivity between neurons is a dynamics entity. Such
changes in synaptic transmission arise from a number of forms of plasticity that
vary in time scale from milliseconds to years. Most short-term forms of synaptic
plasticity affect the amount of neurotransmitter released from presynaptic
terminals in response to a presynaptic action potential. Several forms of
short-term synaptic plasticity--- including facilitation, augmentation, and
potentiation --- enhance neurotransmitter release and are caused by persistent
actions of calcium ions with in the presynaptic terminal. Another form of
short-term plasticity, synaptic depression, decreases the amount of
neurotransmitter released and appears to ge due to an activity-dependent
depletion of synaptic vesicles that ready to undergo exocytosis.

## Habituation & Sensitization
Aplysia exhibit several elementary forms of behavioral plasticity. One form is
**habituation**, a process that causes the animmal to become less responsive to
repeated occurence of a stimulus.

The gill-withdrawal response of *Aplysia* exhibits another form of plasticity
called **sensitization**. Sensitization is a process that allows an animal to
generalize an aversive response eclicited by a noxious stimulus to a variety 
of other, non-noxious stimuli.
