Mechanisms regulating polymerization 

Axon guide 

Non-diffusible signals for axon guidance
## extracelluar matrix cell adhesion moleculesa 
+ the first to be associated with axon growth
+ lamins, dcollagesn, and fibronctin
	+ secreted by cell itself or 
+ cell surface receptors: intergins
+ CAMs and caderins fasciculation(形成束状)

+ ephrins  (-rins alway about ligand)

## Chemoattraction and chemorepulsion

+ small amounts of factor
+ distinguishing tropic molecules and trophic
+ solved by laborios biochemical purfied 

both chemoattraction and chemorepulsion are need, or the axon will stop
growth.

##a Netrins ("to guide") & Slits (repulsion)
+ C. elegans: 
	+ 
+ DCC 

most passway will change the cytoskeletal 

## semaphorin

## Selctive synapse formation
