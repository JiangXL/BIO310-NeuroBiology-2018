Mechanisms regulating polymerization

Axon guide

Non-diffusible signals for axon guidance
## extracelluar matrix cell adhesion moleculesa
+ the first to be associated with axon growth
+ lamins, dcollagesn, and fibronctin
	+ secreted by cell itself or
+ cell surface receptors: intergins
+ CAMs and caderins fasciculation(形成束状)

+ ephrins  (-rins alway about ligand)

## Chemoattraction and chemorepulsion

+ small amounts of factor
+ distinguishing tropic molecules and trophic
+ solved by laborios biochemical purfied
