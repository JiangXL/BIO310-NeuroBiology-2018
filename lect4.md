## 2.3. Modification of neural ciruits as a result of experience

**Critical peroids** is a temporal windows when the environmental factors are
espcially influential in early life. Paretal imprinting and Konad Lorenz's work
with geese are the example. Goslings follow the first large, moving object they
see and hear during their first day of life.没见过老虎的狗会怕老虎叫声,小鸡会害
怕鹰风筝.
