## 2.3 Modification of neural circuits as a result of Experiment

**Critical peroids** is a temporal windows when the environmental factors are
espcially influential in early life. Paretal imprinting and Konad Lorenz's work
with geese are the example. Goslings follow the first large, moving object they
see and hear during their first day of life.没见过老虎的狗会怕老虎叫声,小鸡会害怕鹰风筝.
