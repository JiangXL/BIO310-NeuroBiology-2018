# The Organization and Planning of Movement

##Motor Commands Arise Through Sensorimotor Transformations
Motor ouputs are neural commands that avt on the muscles, causing them to contract 
and generate movment. These outputs are derived from sensory inputs in circuits
that represent _sensorimotor_ 

### The CNS forms internal Models of Sensorimotor Transformations.
Considering the human body from the viewpoint of sensorimotor control, we should
ask two fundamental questions. First, how can we generate actions on the system
so as to control its behavior? Second, how can we predict the consequences of
our actions?
The central nervours system must exercise both control and prediction to achieve
skilled motor performance. Prediction and control are two slides of the same coin,
and the two processes map exactly onto forward and inverse models. Predition turns
motor commands into expected sensory consequences, wheres control turns desired
sensory consequences into motor commands.
